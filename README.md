Puppy Chow/Muddy Buddies Recipe, modified from [Taste Of Home's](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/easy-puppy-chow/).

## Ingredients
- 4 cups Corn Chex
- 4 cups Rice Chex
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup dark chocolate melting wafers
- ¼ cup salted butter
- ¾ cup peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 3 cups powdered sugar

## Directions
1. Combine and melt the chocolates and butter
1. Mix in peanut butter and vanilla
1. Pour the mixture onto the Chex
1. Mix until all is coated
1. Pour about 3/4 cup of powdered sugar in the bottom of a 1 gallon Ziploc bag
1. Pour/scoop/ladle about half of the Chex mixture into the bag
1. Pour about 3/4 cup of powdered sugar on top of the mixture in the bag
1. Close and inflate the bag
1. Shake until all of the mixture is covered
1. Pour out onto waxed paper to cool
1. Repeat with the rest of the mixture

## Notes
- Using different kinds of Chex (rice, corn) is suggested. Rice absorbs the mixture well while corn can make it more crunchy. A half and half mixture is a good mix.
